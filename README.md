# ICP_ML

1. Description
Our project is to improve a non-invasive predictive model alternative to invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. 

2. Dataset
Both datasets are stored in Google Cloud Storage(GCP), and subsets are saved locally

(a)Neurocritical care waveform recordings in pediatric patients
(b)MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Dataset

3. Installation
[Installing WFDB]
This project relies on the WFDB (WaveForm DataBase) Python package for handling waveform data. Follow these steps to install the WFDB package:

Install WFDB using pip:
